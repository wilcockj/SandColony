TODO
Highest Priority first

Make colony member stay on ground when they 
move towards their job

Bushes generatedranomdly
raycasts from above from a plane above the land
do some amount and where they hit a bush shall be placed


Colony member should search their area periodically for jobs
multiple colony members that search for the closest "job" to them
in this prototype case, just a bush

shouldn't go to an empty bush
bush's should recover their stick balance over time (grow)

colony members maybe need a inventory as they would have to carry the
item. How could i do this to handle all items. maybe have lookup table
size of number of items that exist and that gets incremented/decremented
as necessary for each colony member and player.


Down the LINE
--------

vehicles eventually, dune buggy,
turbo camel

colony members can be talked to, to assign jobs,
or by default they will have some priority
of what they will work on. Maybe just idle
till assigned

They will have some amount of happiness that needs to
be tended to. There may be some challenges
that come with not being able to pause to administer
the members. but that could bring some fun. maybe a
physical war horn that needs to be blown to trigger all members to go on attack/ defence. Ways to have many
members follow you

First experiments should be fixed terrain map that I
can put colony members into and see what jobs
they are doing. Give them simple jobs, such as gathering sticks from bushes and depositing somewhere when appropriate


dithering?
