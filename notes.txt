Highest Priority first

worker work location priority is strange?

leader board to show how workers are doing

gain xp for doing a job, get more efficient at doing things

jobs should have a relevant skills that give a benefit

How could i add another job? (rock able to mine)

Down the LINE
--------

vehicles eventually, dune buggy,
turbo camel

colony members can be talked to, to assign jobs,
or by default they will have some priority
of what they will work on. Maybe just idle
till assigned

They will have some amount of happiness that needs to
be tended to. There may be some challenges
that come with not being able to pause to administer
the members. but that could bring some fun. maybe a
physical war horn that needs to be blown to trigger all members to go on attack/ defence. Ways to have many
members follow you

First experiments should be fixed terrain map that I
can put colony members into and see what jobs
they are doing. Give them simple jobs, such as gathering sticks from bushes and depositing somewhere when appropriate


dithering?
